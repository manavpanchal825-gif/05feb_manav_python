2. Machine independent(Run any sysyems)
3. easy to learn and understnds
4. uses simple english like words and syntax
5. python,java,c++ ------> the example of high level programming language
6. slower comperred to low level progamming language
7. takes less time to develop programs
-------------------------------------
**Low level- Programming language**
-------------------------------------
1. language that are closer to machine language and hardware
2. machine dependent (any one type of system)
3. default to learn and understanding
4. uses binary code or assembly instructions
5. assembly language and machine language
6. faster then high level language becose they interects directly with hardware
7. takes more time to develop programs
