# Explain The Function of the TCP/IP Model And Its Layers

**What is TCP/IP**

• the TCp/Ip model is a set of communication protocols
  used to connect devices over the internet.

• it defines how data is transmitted between computers

**TCP/IP stands for**  

>• TCP-Tranmission control protocol

>• IP- inernet protocol 

# Layers of the tcp/ip models

**1. Applicaton Layer**

>• provides network services to user applications 

>• handles protocols like http/ftp/smtp/dns.

>• interface between user and networks

***Examples***

• web browesers like google.

• email services

• file transfer applications

**2. Transprot Layer**

>• provides reliable data transfer 

>• breaks data into segment

>• error checking and flow control 

***Protocols***

• tcp(Reliable communications)

• udp(fast less reliable)

**3. Internet Layer**

>• handles logical addressing

>• routesn packets across networks

>•determines best path for data

***Protocols***

Ip-(Internet protocol)

**4. Network Layer**

>• handles physical transmission of data

>• conmtrols hardware devices

>• converts data into electrical signals

# How TCP/IP works

1. applications creates data
2. transport layer divides data into sigment
3. internet layer adds ip address
4. networks layer sends data through cables 
5. receiver priocesses layer in reverse order 

# client and server in TCP/IP

**Client**
1. sends request to the server 
2. uses TCp/IP to communication
3. EX---a browser requesting a website

**Server**

1. receivers request from client
2. process request 
3. sends responses back using TCP/IP
